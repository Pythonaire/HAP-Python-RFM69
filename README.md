# HAP-Python-RFM69

![Title](Image1.png "Title")

Connect  RFM69 433 MHz devices with the Apple Homekit.

This implementation has two parts: The HAP-Python Gateway and a 433MHzBridge to requests and receive data to/from 433MHz devices. The examples here are a simple weather sensor and a switch to control a sprinkler.

## Equipment

For the HAP Gateway and the the 433MHz Bridge you can use Raspberry Pi's (Zero W, 3B+ 4) or other linux systems like Ubuntu.
The RFM69 devices are in my case Adafruit RFM69HCW Feather boards.

## Installation

### HAP-Python

To use this fist you need to install the HAP-Python HAP-Python <https://github.com/ikalchev/HAP-python> by:

```python
sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
pip3 install HAP-python[QRCode]
```

I like to define my own accessories, i use my own service and characteristic definitions.
@April 2022: some service and characteristic definitions, UI - categories and permissions seems to be de outdated in the HAP-Python repository. If you like to use the newer definitions, copy "const.py" to "/usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/pyhap" and use "loader" to get the newer definitions. 

```python
loader = Loader(path_char='CharacteristicDefinition.json',path_service='ServiceDefinition.json')
...
driver = AccessoryDriver(port=51826, persist_file= persist_file, loader=loader)
```

Next you need to specify the RFM69 bridge and the RFM69 device node number devices in a dictionary, with Node name and node number. See config.py. Note, that the name of your node must be the same as the corresponding HAP-Python device class.
The main script will read the node definition and load the corresponding device class for further information about the device itself. Each device class represent a HAP Accessory.

In Device.py you can find two examples: a weather sensor and a switch (here a imension pump)
Each device class call data from the 433MHzBridge in the set interval. The 433MHzBridge use a Flask server to answer these requests and return sensor values, or send commands to and receive states from the switch.


### 433MHzBridge

For the 433MHzBridge you will need Flask.

```python
sudo pip3 install flask

```
